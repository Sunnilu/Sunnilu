 # 👋 Hi there, I’m Suntha Lucas (@Sunnilu)

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a lifelong learner and former USPS Postmaster turned Full Stack Developer with a passion for building tools that empower and educate. From debugging APIs to writing poetry, I love creating things that connect people to ideas.

## 🌟 About Me

📚 I’m deeply passionate about personal growth, storytelling, and lifelong learning  
🎯 I enjoy reading and writing about life, mindset, and self-improvement  
🎾 When I’m not coding, you’ll find me on the court (pickleball, tennis), the lanes (bowling), or the green (golf)  
⛺ I love all outdoor sports and soaking in nature’s wisdom
